🧩 Final Programming Project
Instructor: Dr. Loubna Dali
Progress Check Due: November 18
Final Project Due: December 5
🎯 Project Goal
Select one Java project from the list below and:
Build the program completely in Java
Prepare a working demo
Present it to your peers by explaining:
How your code works
What your program accomplishes
💻 Project Options

Create a Java application to record and categorize personal expenses.
Features:
Add expenses with description, amount, and category
View all expenses
Generate summary reports (total, average per category, monthly spending)
Concepts Practiced:
OOP (Expense, Category classes), Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap), and File I/O (CSV or JSON).
2. Sales Tracker
Develop a program to process daily sales data from a file.
Features:
Read sales records
Calculate total revenue & quantity per product
Identify best and worst performers
Concepts Practiced:
File I/O, string parsing, Maps for aggregation, and sorting algorithms.
3. Student Gradebook
Simulate a gradebook application.
Features:
Read student info and scores from file
Calculate total, average, and assign letter grades
Display class average and list students below a grade threshold
Concepts Practiced:
OOP (Student, Course classes), File I/O, and conditional logic.
4. Weather Data Analyzer
Analyze a dataset of historical weather information.
Features:
Read daily temperature/humidity/precipitation data
Compute averages, min/max values, and hottest/coldest days
Concepts Practiced:
File I/O, data validation, statistical algorithms, and use of arrays/lists.
5. Word Frequency Counter
Read a text file and count occurrences of each unique word.
Features:
Ignore punctuation and case sensitivity
Display words with frequencies (sorted alphabetically or by count)
Concepts Practiced:
File I/O, string manipulation (regex, toLowerCase()), and Maps (HashMap, TreeMap).
6. Library Borrowing Log
Manage a small library’s borrowed book log.
Features:
Add books and record borrowings
Search by title, author, or student
Flag overdue returns
Concepts Practiced:
OOP (Book, Student classes), Collections (ArrayList, LinkedList), File I/O, and Date handling.
7. Bank Account Ledger
Simulate a simple bank ledger system.
Features:
Track deposits & withdrawals for multiple accounts
Read balances & transactions from a file
Generate transaction reports
Concepts Practiced:
OOP (Account, Transaction classes), File I/O, data validation, and Maps for account management.
🧾 Deliverables
✅ A complete, working Java program with clean source code
✅ An input file (sample data)
✅ An output report displayed on the IDE console
✅ A short presentation covering:
What your program does
How it works (brief walkthrough)
Any challenges you solved
✅ A one-page written reflection report
📝 Written Report: Reflection and Analysis
Each student must submit a 1-page report answering the following questions:
What project did you choose and why?
What was your original plan or algorithm? (Include logic steps.)
What was the biggest challenge you faced?
How did you fix or troubleshoot the issue?
What did you learn from solving that challenge?
Did you modify your original plan? Why or why not?
What Java concepts (loops, methods, arrays, etc.) did you apply?
How did you test your program?
What would you improve or add with more time?
What was the most interesting part of your project and why?
How did you handle debugging or logical errors?
Did you use comments, indentation, and meaningful names?
What was the output of your final test run, and did it meet expectations?
How could this project apply to a real-world situation?
What advice would you give to another student starting this project?
🧠 Tip:
Use good coding practices — comments, indentation, and clear variable names will help both you and others understand your project!
